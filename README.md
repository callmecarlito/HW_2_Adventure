## Files

2. sinocruc.adventure.c

## Features

## Requirements

## compiling and running
Make sure all files are contained within the same directory. To compile the program, navigate to the program directory from your terminal.
Once you are there type "make all" followed by enter key. Once complete, two executable files should appear: `sinocruc.buildrooms.out` and 
`sinocruc.adventure.out`. First begin by running the buildrooms program, if successful, a new subdirectory should be created containing the 
files for each room. Next, run the adventure program which will begin the game.

A "make clean" option has also been added, should you like you can utilize that to remove the executable
files from the directory. 

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact me.

Thanks!
